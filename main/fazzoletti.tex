    \begin{ingredients}
        \entry[2\cups]{all-purpose flour, plus more as needed}
        \entry[1\tsp]{salt, plus more as needed}
        \entry[2]{whole eggs}
        \entry[3]{egg yolks}
    \end{ingredients}

    \begin{instructions}
        Pulse flour and salt in a food processor once or twice.
        Add the eggs and yolks, and turn the machine on.
        Process just until a ball begins to form, about 30 seconds.
        Add a few drops of water if the dough is dry and grainy; add a tablespoon of flour if the dough sticks to the side of the bowl.
        Turn the dough out of the food processor, sprinkle it with a little flour, cover it with plastic or a cloth, and let it rest for about 30 minutes.
        (At this point, you may refrigerate the dough, wrapped in plastic, until youâ€™re ready to roll it out, for up to 24 hours.)

        Bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt it.
        Divide the dough in half.
        Turn one half of the dough onto a lightly floured surface and roll it into a large rectangle no thicker than \quarter\inch and ideally closer to \eighth\inch, adding additional flour sparingly as necessary.
        Repeat with the rest of the dough.

        Cut into squares no larger than 4 inches across.
        Drop the squares into the water and cook until tender, 2 to 3 minutes.
